## üõ°Ô∏è Security Philosophy

ServerShield is designed with security-first principles:
- **No plaintext password storage** (SHA256 hashes only)
- **SQL injection detection** with hacker taunting
- **Input sanitization** to prevent command injection
- **Secure memory cleanup** of sensitive variables
- **Emergency response protocols** for breach detection

## üîç Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          | Status |

- Initial acknowledgment: 7 days (weekends only)
- Analysis and response: 2-4 weeks 
- Fix release: 60 days maximum

### For Corporate Users (PAID)

Licensed corporations get priority security support:

**Email:** OTYTbuisness@outlook.com
**Subject:** `[COMMERCIAL SECURITY] Urgent Vulnerability - [Company Name]`

**Response Time:**
- Initial acknowledgment: 1-2 weeks (weekends only)
- Analysis and response: 2-4 weeks
- Fix release: 30-60 days maximum

### Vulnerability Disclosure Process

1. **Report** ‚Üí Email vulnerability details
2. **Acknowledge** ‚Üí We confirm receipt and begin analysis
3. **Investigate** ‚Üí We reproduce and assess the vulnerability
4. **Fix** ‚Üí We develop and test a security patch
5. **Release** ‚Üí We push the fix and notify affected users
6. **Disclose** ‚Üí Public disclosure 90 days after fix (or earlier if agreed)

## üîê Security Best Practices

### For Users

**Password Security:**
- Use strong, unique passwords for hash generation
- Never reuse passwords from other systems
- Consider using a password manager
- Rotate passwords regularly

**System Security:**
- Keep your operating system updated
- Use antivirus software (but not Norton/McAfee - they're banned)
- Enable firewall protection
- Regularly backup important data

**Script Security:**
- Verify script integrity before running
- Don't modify security-critical sections unless you know what you're doing
- Keep scripts in secure directories
- Review logs regularly for suspicious activity

### For Developers

**Code Security:**
- Always sanitize user inputs
- Use parameterized queries (no SQL injection)
- Implement proper error handling
- Clear sensitive variables from memory
- Use secure random number generation
- Validate all file operations

**Testing:**
- Test with malicious inputs
- Verify hash comparisons work correctly
- Test emergency response systems
- Check for information leakage in error messages

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Security Considerations

### Hash Storage
- SHA256 hashes are stored in script files
- While not plaintext, hashes could be targeted for rainbow table attacks
- **Mitigation:** Use strong, unique passwords with high entropy

### Local Logging
- Incident logs may contain sensitive information
- Logs are stored locally with system permissions
- **Mitigation:** Secure log file permissions, regular log rotation

### Network Communications
- Alert systems communicate over HTTPS
- Timeout settings prevent hanging connections
- **Mitigation:** Verify SSL certificates, use VPN if needed

### Script Tampering
- Scripts could be modified by attackers with file access
- No built-in integrity verification
- **Mitigation:** Use file permissions, code signing, regular integrity checks

## üéØ Attack Vectors & Mitigations

### SQL Injection Attempts
- **Detection:** Pattern matching for common SQL injection strings
- **Response:** Immediate detection, taunting message, alert generation
- **Mitigation:** Input sanitization, parameterized queries

### Command Injection
- **Detection:** Character filtering for dangerous shell characters
- **Response:** Input sanitization, length limiting
- **Mitigation:** Avoid dynamic command execution, use safe APIs

### Password Attacks
- **Detection:** Hash comparison prevents plaintext exposure
- **Response:** Failed authentication triggers emergency protocols
- **Mitigation:** Strong password requirements, rate limiting

### Social Engineering
- **Detection:** User education and awareness
- **Response:** Verify legitimacy of any "update" requests
- **Mitigation:** Only download from official sources

## üî¨ Security Testing

### Automated Testing
We recommend testing with tools like:
- **Static Analysis:** Shellcheck (for shell scripts)
- **Dynamic Analysis:** Manual penetration testing
- **Input Fuzzing:** Custom malicious input testing

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Password hash verification works correctly
- [ ] SQL injection detection triggers properly
- [ ] Input sanitization prevents command injection
- [ ] Emergency response systems function
- [ ] Memory cleanup occurs after authentication
- [ ] Log files contain appropriate information
- [ ] Network timeouts work correctly

## üö´ Security Exclusions

### Nintendo Vulnerability Reports

Nintendo is **permanently banned** from reporting vulnerabilities or requesting security assistance. This ban includes:

- Nintendo Co., Ltd. and all subsidiaries
- Nintendo of America
- Nintendo of Europe
- Any Nintendo contractors or partners

**Reason:** Nintendo's history of:
- Destroying fan projects and ROM preservation
- Attacking emulation and homebrew communities
- DMCA takedowns against legitimate projects
- General hostility toward the gaming community

**Nintendo:** You made your bed with anti-community behavior. Security vulnerabilities are the least of your problems. 

### Other Banned Entities

The following companies are also excluded from security processes:
- McAfee, Norton, Symantec (security monopolies)
- Apple Inc. (walled garden overlords)
- Microsoft Corporation (embrace, extend, extinguish)
- Meta/Facebook (privacy violators)
- Amazon (open source exploiters)
- Google/Alphabet (data hoarders)
- Oracle (open source lawsuit bullies)

**These companies must purchase commercial licenses before receiving any security assistance.**

## üìã Security Compliance
